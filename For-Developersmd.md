To Developers: Understanding the Naming Convention in My Projects

As a developer who maintains a vast ecosystem of diverse and experimental projects, I’ve adopted a consistent and meaningful naming convention to help you (and myself) identify the purpose of each project at a glance.

What Is "başi"?

The word “başi” (or sometimes written as “bashi”) is a Turkish-origin suffix or word element meaning “chief,” “head,” “leader,” or “top.” It historically denoted leadership or authority in the Ottoman era (e.g., Janissary Agha = Yeniçeri Başı, or Alemdarbaşı = standard bearer).

In the context of my projects, “başi” represents the core engine, controller, or master module of a specific domain or system.

Why Use This Convention?

✅ Clarity – You can instantly guess the project's domain from its name.

✅ Organization – Groups similar tools under one recognizable pattern.

✅ Brand Identity – A consistent, memorable signature across all codebases.

✅ Scalability – Easy to expand into submodules (e.g., docsbashi, testbashi).

Examples of Common Naming Patterns

1. shopbashi
A project related to eCommerce or shopping platforms. It may include features like carts, product listings, payment gateways, etc.

2. codebashi
A developer tool to generate, format, or enhance code. May support multiple languages, snippets, or intelligent suggestions.

3. alemdarbashi
Named after the Ottoman term Alemdar (standard bearer), this project focuses on science, education, or research tools. Might include data visualization, experiments, or simulators.

4. storebashi
A full-fledged app store system. Useful for managing downloadable applications, plugins, user reviews, and updates.

5. ai-bashi (custom suggestion)
A project related to Artificial Intelligence, such as chatbots, ML models, or NLP tools.

6. media-bashi (custom suggestion)
Handles multimedia: image editing, video processing, or streaming tools.

7. healthbashi (custom suggestion)
A toolkit or platform dedicated to health data, fitness tracking, or medical research.

8. infra-bashi (custom suggestion)
Short for infrastructure; this could include DevOps tools, server automation, cloud setups, etc.

9. docsbashi (custom suggestion)
A project for managing documentation, wikis, or API references.

10. gamebashi (custom suggestion)
A game engine or tools for building, managing, or distributing games.

Final Notes

If you find any of my repositories named with the suffix başi or bashi, just remember:

It means you are looking at the heart of the system.

This convention is not just a stylistic choice — it’s a mental model to simplify how we perceive and interact with software modules.
