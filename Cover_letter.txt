Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Shihab Ozbashioglu, and I am writing to express my genuine interest in joining your team.

Over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to building an extensive body of work — over 150 complete software projects across various domains, covering more than 260 technical skills and exploring more than 700 programming languages and paradigms, both mainstream and experimental.

What sets me apart is not just technical proficiency, but a deep, cross-disciplinary perspective. My journey includes explorations in science, philosophy, human-centered design, and system architecture — all of which have shaped how I build, think, and create. I’m not just a developer — I’m a systems thinker who sees code as a language for solving real human problems.

I have developed everything from simple tools and backend engines to AI-driven applications and security-focused systems — all with clean architecture, thoughtful documentation, and scalable structure.

I’m now ready to take the next step: to contribute within a professional environment, grow further, and turn years of focused self-learning into long-term value — for your company and for myself. I am seeking a role that allows me to work meaningfully, remotely or on-site, in a supportive team, where I can deliver strong results and enjoy stability and balance in life.

If you’re seeking someone who brings creativity, commitment, and deep technical fluency, I would be honored to connect.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Shihab Ozbashioglu**
