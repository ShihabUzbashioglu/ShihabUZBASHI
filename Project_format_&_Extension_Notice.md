# Project File Format Notice

## Why are some of the source code files saved with a `.txt` extension?

This project was initially developed using a lightweight text editor (Notepad++) on a system where language-specific file extensions were either restricted or intentionally avoided to maintain portability and avoid misinterpretation by system defaults or antivirus tools.

Additionally, using `.txt` extensions ensured easier previews and backups during development on cloud-based platforms and simplified file versioning before final structuring.

### Clarification for Recruiters or Reviewers:

All `.txt` files represent actual source code files written in their respective programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML, etc.). Before running or evaluating the project, please rename the files with their appropriate extensions. For example:
- `main.py.txt` → `main.py`
- `index.html.txt` → `index.html`
- `app.js.txt` → `app.js`

This structure was kept temporarily for simplicity and will be updated in the final deployment branch.

Thank you for your understanding.
